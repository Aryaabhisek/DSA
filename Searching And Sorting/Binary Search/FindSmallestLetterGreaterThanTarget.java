/* You are given an array of characters letters that is sorted in non-decreasing order, 
and a character target. There are at least two different characters in letters.

Return the smallest character in letters that is lexicographically greater than target. 
If such a character does not exist, return the first character in letters.

Example 1:

Input: letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "a"
Output: "c"
Explanation: The smallest character that is lexicographically greater than 'a' in letters is 'c'. */
